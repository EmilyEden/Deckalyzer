This application is a very simple application that allows a Magic the Gathering nerd to keep track of their different cards and decks. There are options to add, edit certain details about, delete, and finally view their current collections of cards and decks. 

The cards table allows you to delete and edit cards, displays how many of one card you might have, and allows you to see if you want to trade that particular card. The deck table allows deleting and editing functions as well, and allows you to see the format of the deck (for example EDH, casual, modern, or standard) and how many times you have one a match with that deck.
